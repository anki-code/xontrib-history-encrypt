## Installation

To install use pip:

```bash
xpip install xontrib-history-encrypt
# or: xpip install -U git+https://github.com/anki-code/xontrib-history-encrypt
```

## Usage: supported encryption

### Base64 (default)

*Protection level: no protection.*

Base64 is not the real encrypter and implemented as fast way to encode history file and for education reasons.
It can save you from the massive scanning the file system for keywords (i.e. password, key) 
as well as reading the history file by not experienced user. But it can be decoded in five minutes by the professional.

```python
# Add to xonsh RC file
$XONSH_HISTORY_ENCRYPTOR = 'base64'
xontrib load history_encrypt
```

### Fernet 

*Protection level: high.*

The implementation of [Fernet](https://cryptography.io/en/latest/fernet.html) (AES CBC + HMAC) that was strongly 
recommended on [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/a/55147077). On first start it generates a key that you 
should save in secure place. Than you can use this key to decrypt the history.

```python
# Add to xonsh RC file
$XONSH_HISTORY_ENCRYPTOR = 'fernet'
xontrib load history_encrypt
```

### Dummy

*Protection level: super high.*

The best encryption of the data when there is no the data. The dummy encryptor stores command only in the memory during 
the session without saving it on the disk. After the end of the session the commands will be lost.

```python
# Add to xonsh RC file
$XONSH_HISTORY_ENCRYPTOR = 'dummy'
xontrib load history_encrypt
```

### Custom 

*Protection level: all in your hands.*

To create custom encryptor you should implement three functions: key getter function, encryptor and decryptor.

```python
# Add to xonsh RC file
$XONSH_HISTORY_ENCRYPTOR = {
  'key': lambda: input('[xontrib-history-encrypt] Enter any key just for fun: '),
  'enc': lambda data, key=None: data[::-1], # just flip the string
  'dec': lambda data, key=None: data[::-1]  # flip the string back
}
xontrib load history_encrypt
```

After debugging you can add your encryptor to the `history_encrypt` directory of the xontrib by PR.

## What should I know?

### How to check the backend is working

```bash
history info
# backend: xontrib-history-encrypt
# sessionid: 374eedc9-fc94-4d27-9ab7-ebd5a5c87d12
# filename: /home/user/.local/share/xonsh/xonsh-history-encrypt.txt
# commands: 1
```

### Some points about the backend

* At start the backend read and decrypt all commands and this could take time. Basically we assume that you will use the xontrib on your servers and haven't so big history.

* The commands are stored in the memory and flush to the disk at the exit from the shell. If the shell has crash there is no flushing to the disk and commands will be lost. Use `history flush` command if you plan to run something experimental.

* The backend has minimal history management support in comparing with json or sqlite backends and you can find the lack of features.

If you want to improve something from the list PRs are welcome!
